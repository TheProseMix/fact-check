(I don't know where to start with this one! I have no faith or respect
for our government, but I don't think they're _intentionally_ trying to
kill people. Moreover, even if that were true, the entire medical
establishment of the country isn't in thrall to them. The healthcare
system is funded by the tax payer, but medical decisions are not the
purview of politicians. Even then, if they were, doctors and nurses are
not mindless robots.)
