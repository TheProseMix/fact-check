There are many reasons why people gamble; the "thrill" being probably
the most obvious. Even intelligent people who understand the risk and
even know, often, the odds are against them, still gamble. One could
argue that things like financial investment and insurance are a form of
gambling. Personally, I find it highly arrogant and reductive to label
anyone who doesn't conform to her views as "stupid".

Each to their own. What I find more offensive, rather than narcissistic,
is her view on gambling addiction. Research[^1] shows that gambling
addiction shares many of the same traits as substance addiction, rather
than the view that it is more of a behavioural control problem.

It follows, therefore, that there must exist intelligent sufferers of
gambling addiction. Either way, even lower-than-average intelligence
sufferers of gambling addiction shouldn't be chastised or accused of
"only having themselves to blame".
