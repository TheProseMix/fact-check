> The BBC's article about the FBI and MI5's warning over China
> conveniently distracts the public while the government is collapsing.

**Note** This, again, is designed to discredit the BBC, by showing its
bias towards its alleged "puppet masters".

This news was also reported as an MI5 press release,[^1], The
Guardian,[^2] Reuters,[^3] ITN,[^4] CNN,[^5] NBC,[^6] and many others;
all at approximately the same time. I doubt they're all trying to save
face for the government.
