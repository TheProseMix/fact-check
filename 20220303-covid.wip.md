These came up on this 3rd March, but are perennial. It's going to take a
lot of work to fact check all these, so I'm just putting my notes here
for now...

* COVID causes "brain damage"
  * Recent Lancet (I think) publication
    * In 50-80yo
    * Shows 1 year of decline
    * Alpha variant
  * Comparison to other things (e.g., alcohol consumption)

* Believing what you read on the Internet
  * An epidemiologist isn't necessarily an expert in neurology
    * Much like an expert in Chinese linguistics may know nothing about,
      say, agglutinative languages of Native Americans.
  * Anecdotal data is not enough to establish causality.
  * It's not unreasonable to be skeptical.

* UK's handling of the pandemic
  * I agree that the UK government have done a bad job and there's some
    pretty sketchy stuff going on
  * New data shows that UK excess deaths are no worse than those other
    European countries; just that UK data collection is more transparent
    (excess deaths vs. COVID deaths)
  * That may change in the future, or be more nuanced than I believe

* COVID transmission by touch
    * Cotton gloves are porous
    * Need to find evidence from WHO, NHS or UK Health Security Agency,
      CDC, Chinese equivalents ("Chinese Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention" and " National Administration of Disease Prevention
      and Control")
