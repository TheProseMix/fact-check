Define "wave". According to WHO data,[^1] there was a slight up-tick in
cases in May/June 2022, peaking at the end of June. However, it is a
local maximum and is low in absolute terms (lower than the Winter
2020/2021 wave). I wouldn't call that a wave and it pales in comparison
with the two previous spikes in December 2021 and March 2022.
