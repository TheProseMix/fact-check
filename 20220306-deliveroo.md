> I need a weekly Deliveroo for snacks.

Fine. However, don't whinge about saving money when you throw so much of
it away on junk food. Don't whinge about the amount of my salary left to
spend on mortgage overpayments when you've spent it on chocolate, crisps
and cake. Don't get me wrong, she is welcome to snacks and having what
she wants, but as soon as you're unfair or duplicitous about it, then
don't expect me to approve.
