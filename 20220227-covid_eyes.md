> You can catch COVID through your eyes.

It's possible, but it's very unlikely. It's so rare, that there doesn't
appear to be enough data to make any useful judgement. Healthcare
workers are at most risk, mainly from touching/rubbing their eyes with
contaminated hands (much less so via aerosol transmission); it may be
advisable for such people to take additional precautions (e.g., visors
or goggles, etc.) when needed.
