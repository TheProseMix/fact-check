**Note** The purpose of her statement was to discredit the western media
(in particular, the BBC; this statement was elicited while listening to
a report on the Russian invasion of Ukraine). That's flagrant
whataboutism. For sake of argument, even if we assume that the US is
currently involved in a hostile incursion of Somalia, that doesn't
preclude the impropriety of the Russian invasion.

The US carried out an airstrike on Somalia, in late-February, against Al
Shabaab militants, who had attacked allied Somali forces.

Al Shabaab is a jihadist terrorist organisation, potentially associated
with al Qaeda and Boko Haram, that targets the (legitimate and
internationally recognised) Federal Government of Somalia and the
African Union Mission to Somalia.

More reasonable questions may be whether it is the US's role to
intervene, what gives them the moral authority to be involved, or what
do they expect in return (if anything)? It's unclear whether their
assistance was expressly requested by the allied Somali government.
