> "Tour" is pronounced [tʊər]; not like "torture".

I pronounce "tour" as [tɔ˞], in my non-rhotic accent. It is allophonic
with "tor" and nearly allophonic with "taw".

Despite the overwhelming arrogance and prescriptivism exhibited in her
assertion, evidence also shows otherwise. From John Wells' "Whatever
Happened to Received Pronunciation?":[^1]

> **Decline and disappearance of /ʊə/.** Words formerly containing the
> diphthong /ʊə/ have come increasingly to be pronounced with /ɔː/
> instead. Thus _your_ is no longer /jʊə/ but /jɔː/. _Poor_, _sure_,
> _moor_, _cure_, _tourist_ are often /pɔː, ʃɔː, mɔː, kjɔː, ˈtɔːrɪst/.
> My survey figures for _poor_ showed that when we group all ages
