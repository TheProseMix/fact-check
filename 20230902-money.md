> Your money is my money.

There is no law in the UK that states your money or property
automatically becomes owned by your spouse. Joint accounts exist and are
owned jointly and the responsibility is shared. However, being married
doesn't mean you can't have separate finances.

In the event of divorce, there is a notion of marital assets.[^1]
