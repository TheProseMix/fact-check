> The US taunted Russia into war so they could:
> 1. Profit from it (i.e., export energy and weaponry to Europe)
> 2. Maintain their hegemony (i.e., letting Russia destroy itself,
>    destabilising Europe and isolating China)

These outcomes _may_ be true, a posteriori. However, that the US
engineered this situation to happen is unfalsifiable which therefore
puts this solidly in the realm of speculation, at best, or conspiracy
theory, at worst.

> Why did NATO refuse to let Russia join after Putin tried several

George Robinson, head of NATO at the time, states[^1] that Putin did not
wish to follow the usual application process, early in his presidency.
That suggests that Russia never applied to join, before NATO's expansion
into the Balkans "put the cat amongst the pigeons", in Putin's eyes.

Russia has a significant Black Sea coast, from Sochi in the south to the
border with Crimea in the North. There, through the Kerch Strait,
Russia's coast extends to the border with Ukraine along the east of the
Sea of Azov.
